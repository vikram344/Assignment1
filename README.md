By design, Git requires every commit to include a commit message describing the purpose of the commit. Typically, this takes the form of a single line, usually limited to around 72 characters, with an optional longer message if desired (Section 4.2.3). Although conventions for commit messages vary (as humorously depicted in the xkcd comic strip “Git Commit”), the style adopted in this tutorial is to write commit messages in the present tense using the imperative mood, as in “Initialize repository” rather than “Initializes repository” or “Initialized repository”. The reason for this convention is that Git models commits as a series of text transformations, and in this context it makes sense to describe what each commit does instead of what it did. Moreover, this usage agrees with the convention followed by the commit messages generated by Git commands themselves (e.g., “merge” rather than “merges” or “merged”). For more information, see the GitHub article “Shiny new commit styles”.
